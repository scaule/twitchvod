# Twitch VOD Stream URL Extractor - RESEARCH PROJECT

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS RESEARCH CODE ONLY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**

This project is **EXCLUSIVELY** for educational and research purposes. It demonstrates how to interact with Twitch's GraphQL API and extract streaming URLs from video metadata.

## üö® LEGAL AND ETHICAL DISCLAIMERS

- **DO NOT USE THIS TOOL TO DOWNLOAD OR REDISTRIBUTE TWITCH CONTENT**
- **DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT**
- **DO NOT USE THIS TOOL TO CIRCUMVENT TWITCH'S TERMS OF SERVICE**
- **RESPECT CONTENT CREATORS' RIGHTS AND TWITCH'S PLATFORM POLICIES**

This code is provided as-is for **ACADEMIC RESEARCH** and **LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY**. Users are responsible for ensuring their use complies with all applicable laws, Twitch's Terms of Service, and content creators' rights.

## Research Purpose

This tool demonstrates:
- How to extract video IDs from Twitch URLs using regex
- How to make authenticated requests to Twitch's GraphQL API
- How to parse GraphQL responses to extract streaming metadata
- Go programming techniques for HTTP clients and JSON handling

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Valid Twitch Client ID (obtain from Twitch Developer Console for research purposes)

## Building for Research

### Using Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
# Build both CLI and server versions
make build

# Build only CLI version
make build-cli

# Build only server version
make build-server

# Run tests
make test
```

### Manual Building
```bash
# Set your research Client ID
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="your_research_client_id"

# Build CLI version
go build -o twitchvod cmd/cli/main.go

# Build server version
go build -o twitchvod-server cmd/server/main.go
```

## Research Usage

### CLI Version
```bash
# Example research usage
./twitchvod https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1234567
```

### HTTP Server Version
```bash
# Set environment variables
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="your_research_client_id"
export SECRET="your_secret_key"

# Start the server
./twitchvod-server

# Make a request
curl "http://localhost:8080/extract?url=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1234567&secret=your_secret_key"
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "url": "https://fake-cdn.example.com/video/1234567/chunked/index-dvr.m3u8"
}
```

## Research Output

The tool outputs streaming metadata URLs for research analysis:
